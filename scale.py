DOKI weighing station — the scale, with no GUI dependency.

Everything in this module runs and is tested without a display: frame parsing,
de-duplication, stability, staleness, the serial reader and its reconnect
loop, the batch log and the recipe config.

Deliberately Qt-free. The panel imports this; this imports nothing of the
panel. Same split as doki_probe.ino, where the cook state machine is plain
C++ so the test harness can lift it out verbatim.
